I'm an activist. I want to make a better world. That clearly makes me a good person.

Those fascist pigs say my ideas have always failed and are doomed to fail again, but they are blind. My ideas, if well implemented, cannot fail.

Unlike my ideals, the current system is doomed to fail because it is weak, it's on its late stage. My ideas have not started to work yet because those imperialist pigs have crushed them before real social change happened.

The fascist idiots have blind faith in illusions like their God, families and countries. I don't have blind faith, I know. I know something real, something scientific and empowering that have to work soon or later. I don't need the stupid blind faith that the religious have, because I know my ideas will work someday. My ideas feel so right. They can't be wrong.

It is not enough to change my country, I want to change the world!
It is not enough to change my community, I want to change the world!
It is not enough to change myself, I want to change the world!

As a progressive, my ideals are good. All progressive ideas are good! That's why they are considered progressive ideas, after all. If new ideas were bad, they would not be progressive after a while, but fascist. Without progressive ideas, we would still have slavery, sexism and poverty. My ideas are good because they are progressive ideas, and those who disagree with me are clearly not progressive at all.

I'm on the right side of history!

The idiots die for their countries, families and faith. I want die for something higher! People will remember me for centuries as their social and moral hero, because I was able to see what the others refused to. That's the very purpose of an activist, to make others see. Finally I have a purpose and a meaning that does not realies on lies and stupid traditions that will soon be replaced by something better, something higher. 

I don't know exactly what the world I'm creating will look like, no one does, but it must be better than this one. Anything is better than this evil, imperialistic and oppresive system. This system must be replaced with something more concious, focused and powerful. Something that works, like my ideals, if well implemented. If my ideas failed before, or happen to fail again, they were clearly not well implemented, but probably corrupted by those fascists.

I'm empowered. I'm a hero. I'm humbled by my own relative higher moral standard, unlike those fascist pigs who love their country and people just because they were born, rised and educated there. Those are the most stupid reasons to love anything! They must change the world with my ideals instead being hold back by their stupid attachments to an oppresive culture.

I'm an activist. I literally can't be wrong. That clears me off my own privilege and makes me a better, decent human being.

I'm in the right side of history, and I will fight for something different, no matter the cost.
